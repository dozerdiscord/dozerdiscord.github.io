    <h1>This is a work in progress! This guide may not be complete.</h1>
    
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>Howdy! This is the quickstart guide for Dozer. This will walk you through how to get the best experience from Dozer on your Discord server.
        Not all of these steps are required, but these are recommended for the best experience.</p>
    
        <h3>Webhook setup</h3>
    <p>Dozer has an official Twitter account that is used to notify users of outages and other important information. If you would like to have this feed relayed to 
        a channel in your server, please create a webhook in the channel you would like the feed to go to and send the webhook URL to tweirtx (Travis from FRC team 5052)
    </p>
    
    <h3>Join/leave logs</h3>
    <p>If you want Dozer to send embeds when people join or leave, all you have to do is give Dozer send permissions in the right channel and run &memberlogconfig (channel)
        where (channel) is a #channel-name.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Message edit/deletion logs</h3>
    <p>To set up logs of when someone edits/deletes a message (typically used for moderation purposes), run &messagelogconfig (channel) where (channel) is a #channel-name</p>
    
    <h3>Giveme roles</h3>
    <p>To add a role to the list of roles people can give themselves, simply run &giveme add (role name). To remove, do &giveme removefromlist (role name).</p>

    <p>Todo: modlogs, linkscrub, memberconfig, nmconfig, welcomeconfig, voicebinds</p>
